# Sonic Scream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pingzing/sonic-scream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pingzing/sonic-scream)

A ground-up rewrite of the [Dota 2 Sound Editor](https://github.com/pingzing/dota2-sound-editor), 
now with compatibility for Dota 2 Reborn.

Written in JavaFX, built as a Gradle project.

(Name not final. Possible other choices: Sonic Wave, Sonic WAV, etc)

##Building
###Requirements
* JDK 8u60 (Because u60 introduces proper DPI scaling on Windows) with JavaFX
* Gradle
* (Semi-Optional) An up-to-date Dota 2 installation. (Only necessary for actually running the app. Building and development work doesn't _strictly_ require it, but it helps.)
